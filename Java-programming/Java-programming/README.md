 Java Programming: From Basics to System Architecture
This folder contains my Java development journey, focusing on clean code and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

  Learning Roadmap

   Phase 1: Absolute Basics
     Concept: Environment setup and "Hello World".
     Goal: Understanding the structure of a Java class and the `main` method.

   Phase 2: Logic & Control Flow
     Concept: Decision making (`if-else`) and repetition (`loops`).
     Goal: Writing logic to handle user input and basic calculations.

   Phase 3: OOP Foundations
     Concept: Classes, Objects, and Methods.
     Goal: Modeling real-world entities (like a 'Medicine') as objects with attributes and behaviors.

   Phase 4: Pharmacy Inventory System (Main Project)
   System Features: 
     Add Medicine: Creating new records in a dynamic list.
     Update Stock: Modifying existing data quantities.
     Display/Remove: Viewing and deleting inventory items.
     Technical Skills: Java `ArrayList`, OOP Inheritance/Encapsulation, and a Console-based Menu System.

These are the successful outputs of my codes👇

Step by step on how to run my java programming codes successfully using android.
1. Open code editor AIDE
2, click file, new file 
3. it will be named untitled by default 
4. Now copy my code from GitHub 
5. Paste in the untitled file you created 
7. Save the file observing java naming eg ArithmeticBasis 
8. by default its the file name.txt now change from text to be .java example ArithmeticBasis.java
9. click done 
8. click the triangle button in the bottom 
9. when you click the triangle button it will bring you a dialog where you have to choose, choose the programming language as java and leave the other boxes as default 
10. click execute. The codes will run successfully by giving outputs.
