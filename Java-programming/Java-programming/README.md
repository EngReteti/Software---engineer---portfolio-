 Java Programming: From Basics to System Architecture
This folder contains my Java development journey, focusing on clean code and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

  Learning Roadmap

   Phase 1: Absolute Basics
     Concept: Environment setup and "Hello World".
     Goal: Understanding the structure of a Java class and the `main` method.

   Phase 2: Logic & Control Flow
     Concept: Decision making (`if-else`) and repetition (`loops`).
     Goal: Writing logic to handle user input and basic calculations.

   Phase 3: OOP Foundations
     Concept: Classes, Objects, and Methods.
     Goal: Modeling real-world entities (like a 'Medicine') as objects with attributes and behaviors.

   Phase 4: Pharmacy Inventory System (Main Project)
   System Features: 
     Add Medicine: Creating new records in a dynamic list.
     Update Stock: Modifying existing data quantities.
     Display/Remove: Viewing and deleting inventory items.
     Technical Skills: Java `ArrayList`, OOP Inheritance/Encapsulation, and a Console-based Menu System.
