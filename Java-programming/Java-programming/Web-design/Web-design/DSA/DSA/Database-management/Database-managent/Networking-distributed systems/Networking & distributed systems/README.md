 Networking & Distributed Systems
This folder tracks my journey from basic socket programming to building fault-tolerant distributed systems.

 Learning Roadmap

  Level 1: Basic Client-Server Chat
     Concept: Establishing a TCP connection between a single client and a server.
     Goal: Client sends a "Hello" message, and the server sends a response.

  Level 2: Multi-Client Server
     Concept: Using Multi-threading to handle multiple simultaneous connections.
     Goal: Multiple users connecting to a single chat server at the same time without the server crashing.

  Level 3: Distributed Systems Simulation (3 Nodes)
     Concept: Data replication and Leader Election.
     Goal: A simulation of 3 nodes where one node acts as a "Leader" to coordinate data storage across the other two nodes.
