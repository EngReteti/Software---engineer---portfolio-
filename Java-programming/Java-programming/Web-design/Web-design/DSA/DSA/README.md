Data Structures & Algorithms: Basics to Sorting
This folder tracks my understanding of memory management and algorithm time efficiency.

 Core Projects

Level 1: Absolute Basics
   Focus: Understanding how Arrays store data in memory.
   Project: Initializing arrays,sum of the array and accessing the elements in an array.

Level 2: Linear Search
   Focus: Iteration and conditional logic.
   Project: Searching for a specific number within an integer array and showing the index of an array when found.

Level 3: Sorting Random Datasets
   Focus: Algorithm logic and execution.
   Project: Generating an array of 50 random numbers,sorting them using Bubble/Selection sort and measure the execution time taken by each sorting algorithm.


Objective: Optimize data processing and search/sort efficiency.

Feature: Performance benchmarking of Bubble, Selection, and Merge Sort with execution timers.

Why: Proves understanding of Time Complexity (O notation) to ensure software handles large data sets efficiently.
