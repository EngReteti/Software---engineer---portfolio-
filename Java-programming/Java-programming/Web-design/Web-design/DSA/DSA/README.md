Data Structures & Algorithms: Basics to Sorting
This folder tracks my understanding of memory management and algorithm efficiency.

 Core Projects

Level 1: Absolute Basics
   Focus: Understanding how Arrays store data in memory.
   Project: Initializing arrays and accessing elements by index.

Level 2: Linear Search
   Focus: Iteration and conditional logic.
   Project: Searching for a specific number within an integer array.

Level 3: Sorting Random Datasets
   Focus: Algorithm logic and execution.
   Project: Generating an array of 50 random numbers and sorting them using Bubble/Selection sort.
