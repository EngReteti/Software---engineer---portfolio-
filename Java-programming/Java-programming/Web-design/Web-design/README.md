 Web Design & UI Development
This folder documents my progression from static HTML structures to dynamic, validated web interfaces.

 Learning Roadmap

   Phase 1: Simple Webpage (HTML Basics)
      Focus: Semantic HTML5 tags (headings, paragraphs, lists).
      Goal: Creating a clean, readable content structure.

   Phase 2: Styling with CSS
     Focus: Visual design and layout.
     Goal: Using CSS for colors, fonts, and spacing to improve user experience.

   Phase 3: Updating Webpage Content
    Focus: Content maintenance and Document Object Model (DOM) basics.
    Goal: Learning how to efficiently modify and expand existing page elements.

   Phase 4: Advanced Form Validation (JavaScript)
     Focus: Client-side logic and data integrity.
     Goal: A "CUK" form that validates both name and email format while preventing empty submissions.
